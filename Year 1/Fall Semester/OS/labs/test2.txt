Hello from Debrecen. My name is Meshack Bosire. I  am studying beside my 
friend and roomate Manuel in Veres peter preparing fot OS and Logic quiz 
which I am sitting for on Tuesday 21 November 2023 at 12 and 16 hours 
respectively. I am happy to be part of the Debrecen community although it 
is getting cold and we are spending most of the time indoors.

The school is beautiful, serene gentle and lovely. I have met a few 
friends from CIDC church and some good classmates too. I thank God for 
putting me in such a welcoming and lovely school and I promise to do my 
best to achieve success and pass well in my exams

I pray for my mum and dad back at home, God keep them safe till they see 
me graduate from this institution successfully. 

AMEN!!!
